==========

Android application that was developed, tested, and deployed back in 2011-2013. The app was built to run on TMobile G2 phones running Android v2.3. 

#### TODO:
- Port the code so that it will compile in Android Studio (it was originally developed using Eclipse). [Done]
- Change/update the backend/cloud component. Original app required a backend component that has since been taken offline.
- Update UI to accomodate modern devices. Original app ran on G2 phones, which was a 3.7" screen.
